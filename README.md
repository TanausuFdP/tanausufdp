# 👋 Hey, I’m Tanausú Fernández

## About Me

I’m a **Full Stack Developer** with 5 years of professional experience, focused on building useful, human-centered products and clean, scalable systems.

I enjoy working on products that actually solve problems — from internal team tools to user-facing applications — and I care a lot about code quality, DX, and long-term maintainability.

🌱 Constantly learning and refining how I work (both technically and personally).
<br />
🧠 Interested in productivity, systems thinking, and mental health–aware development.
<br />
🤝 I value collaboration, clear communication, and pragmatic decision-making.
