### 👋 Hi there!!

👨🏻‍🎓 I am Tanausú Fernández, a Junior Full-Stack Developer looking forward to putting all my knowledge into practice in large projects.

⚙ I enjoy creating new Simple Web, Desktop or Mobile Projects on my own, or being part of a working group on a more ambitious project, no matter what languages and technologies are used (I always like to learn new experiences).

📃 In my Computer Engineering Degree I learnt mostly Java, C, C++, SQLite, MySQL, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Ajax, PHP and JSP, while practicing SCRUM (such as other Agile Methodologies). My Final Degree Project consisted of a mobile VR client-app (in Unity) and a Desktop serv-app.

📈 Since my graduation to the present I have been learning Vue JS, Three JS, Symphony, React and Angular on my own.

🧩 Outside of tech too, I am a person who love being relaxed, playing videogames, reading books, watching films, going to the beach and spending time with my family and friends. I like travelling to new places as soon as I can and learning new cultures.

🎖 I consider myself a very creative person, having several projects in mind. Responsibility, professionalism and creativity are three of the qualities that describe me.
